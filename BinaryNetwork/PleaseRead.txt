Hello, this is my first neural network :D

To use this program, run the "simpleNetwork.py" file.

Click on the "Open File" button then choose a file to test.

You can find some sample in the "sampleData" file.

If you want to draw your own image to test, make sure that:

1) It is 28x28
2) It has a dark background (preferably black)
3) You use a light coloured brush (preferably white)
